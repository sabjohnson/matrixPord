multiplies a matrix and its transpose

this was a small side challenge to create a program that multiplies a matrix and its transpose using 2d arrays. First i created a function to create a transpose from a given array and then a function to multiply them. I hardcoded the original array; the resulting transpose will change accordingly. The purpose of this was to learn how C handles passing arrays/the use of pointers because it is different from JS.
